so-dashboard
============

This is just a fork of the awesome project <a href="https://github.com/ManifestWebDesign/angular-gridster">angular-gridster</a>. So go there if you want to read the documentation.

This fork removes jQuery and jQuery-UI dependencies and adds custom Drag 'n' Resize implementation. 

I needed it for my other project and couldn't wait it to be done by angular-gridster team. 


Tested with FF, Chrome and Safari on OSX.  

##Demo

See <a href="http://rawgit.com/SekibOmazic/so-dashboard/master/index.html">Live demo</a>



## TO DO

~~ Add an option handle to gridster-item (like jQuery-UI)~~
